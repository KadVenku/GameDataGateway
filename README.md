## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the SOLID principles at all times.
- Keep your methods short and readable. Long methods with a lot of nested statements can usually be split into multiple smaller methods.
- Your method names should state what the method does.
- Don't start your interface names with "I", rather add an "Imp" suffix or a more descriptive name to the implementation.
